I am a rising 4-th year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/), Northwestern University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Diego Klabjan](https://dynresmanagement.com/index.html). My major is applied statistics and statistical learning, with a minor in simulation and stochastic analysis. I have also worked with Dr. [Matthew Plumlee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-plumlee-a072361a/), Principal applied scientist at Amazon.

For the summer and fall of 2024, I am interning with the Global Pricing Team at McDonald's as a recommendation system researcher.

My research interests broadly encompass statistics, machine learning, applied probability, and stochastic simulation. Specifically, my work focuses on computational methods for uncertainty quantification in machine learning and stochastic operations research.

Before joining Northwestern, I received my B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Fudan University, and my M.S. degree in mathematical statistics from Purdue University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Raghu Pasupathy](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~pasupath/).

Please find my latest CV [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zkmdytszbypg#e65dbb).

I am actively seeking internship positions for spring, summer, and fall 2025 in roles such as student researcher, applied scientist, research scientist, data scientist, machine learning engineer, and quantitative researcher.
