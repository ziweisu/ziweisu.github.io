I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/), Northwestern University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Diego Klabjan](https://dynresmanagement.com/index.html) and Prof. [Matthew Plumlee](http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~mplumlee/) (On leave at Amazon), majoring in applied statistics and statistical learning with a minor in simulation and stochastic analysis.

I am broadly interested in non-parametric statistics, statistical learning, applied statistics, and stochastic simulation. In particular, my research covers computational methods for uncertainty quantification in machine learning and stochastic operations research.

Before joining Northwestern, I received my B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Fudan University, and my M.S. degree in mathematical statistics from Purdue University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Raghu Pasupathy](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~pasupath/).

Please find my latest CV [here](https://ziweisu.github.io/files/CV_Ziwei_Su.pdf).

I am actively looking for **2024 summer internship positions** in **applied scientist, research scientist, data scientist, machine learning engineer, and quant researcher** roles.

I will present my work <em>'Calibration of Inexact Stochastic Simulation Models via Minimizing Scoring Rules under Kernelized Discrepancies'</em> [\[Abstract\]](https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/?__hstc=194041586.25a158d799955c9e28b4cac1b2d4cea0.1683759608597.1695755968069.1695924267557.14&__hssc=194041586.1.1695924267557&__hsfp=970765120&hsCtaTracking=8565990a-f890-45db-8248-5e530111907a%7C2782dcb1-3c43-4263-8050-061684381408#!/10856/presentation/9497) at INFORMS Annual Meeting 2023:
