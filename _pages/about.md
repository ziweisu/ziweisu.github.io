I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences, Northwestern University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Diego Klabjan and Prof. Matthew Plumlee (On leave at Amazon), majoring in applied statistics and statistical learning with a minor in simulation and stochastic analysis.

I am broadly interested in non-parametric statistics, statistical learning, applied statistics, and stochastic simulation. In particular, my research covers computational methods for uncertainty quantification in machine learning and stochastic operations research.

Before joining Northwestern, I received my B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Fudan University, and my M.S. degree in mathematical statistics from Purdue University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Raghu Pasupathy.
