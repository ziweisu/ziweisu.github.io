I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/), Northwestern University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Diego Klabjan](https://dynresmanagement.com/index.html), majoring in applied statistics and statistical learning with a minor in simulation and stochastic analysis. I have also worked with Dr. [Matthew Plumlee]([http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~mplumlee/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-plumlee-a072361a/)) (Principal applied scientist at Amazon).

I am broadly interested in statistics, statistical learning, applied probability, and stochastic simulation. In particular, my research covers computational methods for uncertainty quantification in machine learning and stochastic operations research.

Before joining Northwestern, I received my B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Fudan University, and my M.S. degree in mathematical statistics from Purdue University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Raghu Pasupathy](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~pasupath/).

Please find my latest CV [here](https://ziweisu.github.io/files/CV_Ziwei_Su_1.pdf).

I am actively looking for 2024 summer internship positions in student researcher, applied scientist, research scientist, data scientist, machine learning engineer, and quant researcher roles.
