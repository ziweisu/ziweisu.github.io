I am a rising final-year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/), Northwestern University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Diego Klabjan](https://dynresmanagement.com/index.html). My major is applied statistics and statistical learning with a minor in simulation and stochastic analysis. 

I am also fortunate to work with Prof. [Imon Banerjee](https://ibanerj750.github.io/). 

My research interests broadly encompass statistics, statistical machine learning and applied probability. Specifically, my work focuses on theory and computational methods for uncertainty quantification. 

I am now interning with Middle Mile Product Research & Optimization (mmPROS) at Amazon. My hosts are Dr. [Phil Kaminsky](https://kaminsky.ieor.berkeley.edu/) and Prof. [Adam Elmachtoub](https://www.columbia.edu/~ae2516/). From June to December 2024, I worked with the Global Pricing Team at McDonald's as a recommendation system researcher. 

Before joining Northwestern, I received my B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Fudan University, and my M.S. degree in mathematical statistics from Purdue University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Raghu Pasupathy](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~pasupath/).

Please find my latest CV [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zkmdytszbypg#e65dbb).

My [Erdős number](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/freetools/collab-dist) is 3: Ziwei Su - Diego Klabjan - Craig A. Tovey - Paul Erdős.
