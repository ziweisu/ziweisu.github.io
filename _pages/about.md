I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/), Northwestern University.

My research interests broadly encompass statistics and probability. 

From June to December 2024, I worked with the Global Pricing Team at McDonald's as a researcher. I will be joining Amazon in June 2025 as an applied scientist intern on the Middle Mile Marketplace Science team.
